            Write down your position and also your current hit points, wounds, injuries, sanity and corruption values; then, sustain (4) this spell. Then, as a reaction, you go back to the position that you wrote down; also, your hit points, wounds, injuries, sanity and corruption go back to the values that you wrote down. Once you do so, this spell ends.
